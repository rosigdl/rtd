    "* compositionality\n",
    "    - compositionality emphasizes that the whole can be understood by studying its parts and their interactions. it plays a vital role in understanding how structures and properties of mathematical objects are preserved or transformed when they are combined or related through morphisms. Category theory provides a high-level, abstract framework to study compositionality by focusing on objects, morphisms, and their compositions, as well as functors and natural transformations between categories. This abstraction enables mathematicians to identify and study compositional principles that are common to various areas of mathematics and, in some cases, other disciplines.\n",

    "### Yoneda lemma\n",
    "\n",
    "The Yoneda lemma is a crucial principle in category theory that emphasizes the importance of understanding objects in a category by examining their relationships with other objects, as represented by morphisms. The lemma highlights the role of morphisms and their compositions in revealing connections among various mathematical structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In formal terms, let C be a locally small category (meaning that the collection of morphisms between any pair of objects in C forms a set), and let Set denote the category of sets. For any object A in C, there exists a covariant functor Hom(A, -): C → Set. This functor maps an object B in C to the set of morphisms Hom(A, B) in C and maps a morphism f: B → C to the morphism Hom(A, f): Hom(A, B) → Hom(A, C), which is the result of postcomposition with f.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Yoneda lemma states that for any covariant functor F: C → Set and any object A in C, there is a natural bijection between the set of natural transformations from Hom(A, -) to F and the set F(A), i.e., Nat(Hom(A, -), F) ≅ F(A). The bijection is established as follows: given a natural transformation η: Hom(A, -) → F, η_A: Hom(A, A) → F(A) is obtained by applying η to A, and the element η_A(id_A) ∈ F(A) corresponds to η, where id_A denotes the identity morphism on A.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the Yoneda lemma asserts that an object A can be described by the morphisms from A to all other objects in the category. This means that an object's properties are determined by its relationships with other objects through morphisms. This understanding has significant implications across various areas of mathematics and offers a powerful method for investigating mathematical structures and concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important consequence of the Yoneda lemma is the Yoneda embedding, which embeds any category into a category of functors. This embedding enables the study of categories and their objects through the behavior of functors and natural transformations, leading to further generalizations and unifying insights across different areas of mathematics."
