    "### Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is characterized by two unique features: (1) It employs a hybrid representation that integrates both convolutions and descriptors. This structure enables the model to learn task-specific encodings with flexibility, while also benefiting from the robust prior provided by fixed descriptors. (2) The model learns to build molecular encodings through the use of convolutions centered on bonds rather than atoms, which eliminates the need for redundant loops during the message-passing stage of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we demonstrate that using a scaffold-based division of training and testing data is an effective approximation of the industry-standard temporal split, as measured by relevant metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection of hyperparameters is critical to the performance of the model. Depending on the choice, performance improvements can range from a modest 2-5% to a substantial 37%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across the seven public datasets, there is no single baseline model that consistently outperforms the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The direction in which messages are passed is significant. The model uses one-hot encodings for both atom and bond features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Bayesian Optimization through the Hyperopt Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating additional features results in varying performance across different datasets. Some datasets exhibit significant improvements, while others show a decline in performance. This could be attributed to the additional features either enhancing the model's understanding or causing confusion and distraction in certain tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of the model is that it does not make use of 3D structural information."
